OVERVIEW: RAPID CAR RACER GAME IN PYTHON
1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
   - A console-based car racing game developed in Python, where players control a car to navigate a busy road and avoid obstacles.
   - The goal is to race as long as possible without colliding with obstacles, achieving high scores based on distance.

2. TOOLS USED:
   - Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Used as the primary code editor for developing and testing the game.
   - Python Interpreter: Executes the game script in a terminal or console.

3. GAME FEATURES:
   - Console-based Graphics: Simple yet engaging graphics displayed in the console.
   - Obstacle Avoidance: The player maneuvers the car to avoid oncoming obstacles.
   - Score System: Players earn points based on how far they drive without collisions.
   - Increasing Difficulty: Game speed or obstacle frequency may increase as the player progresses.

4. GAMEPLAY INSTRICTIONS:
   - Step 1: Start the game by running the Python file in the terminal.
   - Step 2: Use specific keys (e.g., '<' for left, '>' for right) to control the car's position on the road.
   - Step 3: Avoid obstacles by switching lanes and maintain a high score by driving longer.
   - Step 4: The game ends if the car collides with an obstacle, displaying the final score.

5. HOW TO RUN THE GAME:
   - Prerequisites: Ensure that Python is installed and accessible via the command line.
   - Run Command: Open the terminal and execute:
     For installing Pygame:
     >>>>pip install pygame
     >>>>python car_game.py
  
   - INSTRUCTIONS FOR EXECUTION:
     - Navigate to the folder containing the `car_road_racer.py` file in the terminal.
     - Enter the command above to start the game and begin playing.

6. GAME RULES:
   - Avoid Obstacles: Colliding with any obstacle ends the game.
   - Controls: Use designated keys to control the car's direction (details in-game).
   - Scoring: The longer you avoid obstacles, the higher your score.
